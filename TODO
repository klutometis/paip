  We could reverse the name, and play the first-name trick; I'd like
  to recurse, though, and backtrack when we encounter something in
  =*suffices*=.

  Pathological case when the only same is e.g. `Jr.'? `Jr.' is the
  result.

  Some things implicit in this solution: if it's not =null=, it's a
  list; of it's not =listp=, it's an atom.

  #+BEGIN_SRC lisp :tangle 1.3.lisp :shebang #!/usr/local/bin/sbcl --script
    (defun count-atoms (expression)
      (if (null expression)
          0

            (+ (if (listp elt) (count-atoms elt) 1)
               (count-atoms (cdr expression))))))
    
    (assert (= (count-atoms '(a (b d) c)) 4))    
  #+END_SRC

  How does this behave when =computor= is itself a list?

  #+BEGIN_SRC lisp :tangle 1.4.lisp :shebang #!/usr/local/bin/sbcl --script
    (defun count-anywhere (computor computandum)
      (if (null computandum)
          0
          (let ((elt (car computandum)))
            (+ (if (listp elt) (count-anywhere computor elt) (if (eql computor elt) 1 0))
               (count-anywhere computor (cdr computandum))))))
    
    (assert (= (count-anywhere 'a '(a ((a) b) a)) 3))

  We'll map the lists, producing an initial product; then reduce by
  addition.

  #+BEGIN_SRC lisp :tangle 1.5.lisp :shebang #!/usr/local/bin/sbcl --script
    (defun dot-product (x y)
      "Compute the dot product, where x and y are lists of integers."
      (apply #'+ (mapcar #'* x y)))
    
    (assert (= (dot-product '(10 20) '(3 4)) 110))
  #+END_SRC

   - context-free phrase-structure grammar
   - generative syntax
   - thus, they are not functions in the mathematical sense, but they
     are called functions in lisp, because they return a value.
   - all functions in grammar, list of words; apply append.
   - think of the position numbers as telling you how far you are from
     the front.
     - pretty good advice
   - i include the symbol =->=, even though it serves no real purpose;
     it is purely decorative.

   - a variable is routinely changed during the course of running the
     program; a paramemter will normally stay constant.
   - a change to a parameter is considered a change to the program,
     not by the program.
